# ðŸš€ Quick Setup Guide - Fix the Error

The error you're seeing is because the Google Sheet ID is not configured. Here's how to fix it:

## ðŸ”§ Step 1: Create a Google Sheet

1. Go to [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com)
2. Click "Blank" to create a new spreadsheet
3. Name it "Dil Khush Orders"
4. Copy the Sheet ID from the URL:
   ```
   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/YOUR_SHEET_ID_HERE/edit
   ```
   The Sheet ID is the long string between `/d/` and `/edit`

## ðŸ”§ Step 2: Update Google Apps Script

1. Go to [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com)
2. Open your project (the one with the URL you're using)
3. Find this line in `Code.gs`:
   ```javascript
   const SHEET_ID = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID_HERE';
   ```
4. Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID_HERE` with your actual Sheet ID:
   ```javascript
   const SHEET_ID = '1ABC123DEF456GHI789JKL'; // Your actual Sheet ID
   ```
5. Click "Save" (Ctrl+S)

## ðŸ”§ Step 3: Test the Connection

1. Open `test-google-script.html` in your browser
2. Enter your Google Script URL: `https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbwfY0skPB3_3ibqc4lf8i9BwlRN7kA-AQaiCzSx-1tOkQKOx5GtcGPURi0glo0tPUNSnQ/exec`
3. Click "Test Connection"
4. You should see a success message

## ðŸ”§ Step 4: Test Order Submission

1. In the test page, click "Submit Test Order"
2. Check your Google Sheet - you should see a new row with test data

## âœ… That's It!

Once you complete these steps, your order form will work perfectly and save all orders to your Google Sheet automatically.

## ðŸ†˜ Still Having Issues?

If you're still getting errors:

1. **Check the browser console** (F12) for any JavaScript errors
2. **Verify the Sheet ID** is correct in your Google Apps Script
3. **Make sure the sheet exists** and is accessible
4. **Test the connection** using the test page first

The error should be completely resolved once you set up the Google Sheet ID!
